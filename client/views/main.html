			  This project started during summer semester 2015, at the Design & art University of 
				Bolzano. Developed with Zen metodology thanks to our project leader Andrea Maragno and Prof. Simone 
				Simonelli, this started as a wish of mine to reintroduce poetry in everyoneâ€™s life. It started as something

				took inspiration for the style.Further more I can say that I am glad for everyone who takes part in this and believe in 
				this unbelievably-superimport-antpartlyuseless-fun idea.
